    "There's a couple reasons we have identified to motivate studying Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Julia is **_fast_**. It offers a notable speed improvement from interpreted languages like Python.\n",
    "2. Julia is **intuitive**. It's familiar to languages you might have dealt with before and its syntax is easy to pick up and learn.\n",
    "3. Julia is **predictable**. You can define types (that are actually enforced, cough cough... _Python_), and the language operates off of a set of base functions that can be modified or extended through multiple dispatch.\n",
    "4. Julia is the **future**. It's flexible and fun to write. There's a growing programmer community around the language. It can be integrated into other languages and other languages can be integrated into Julia. Expect to see at as part of more projects in the future."

When defining a variable, Julia does a very good job of determining what type of variable you want and automatically assigns a type to it for you.

I love the way it looks but it is kind of difficult to use and read, so I do not recommend using it most of the time.
