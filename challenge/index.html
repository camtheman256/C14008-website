Loopholes are lame.</p> <li><p>If you have any questions with these rules, email us at <a href="mailto:c14008-teachers@esp.mit.edu">c14008-teachers@esp.mit.edu</a> and we&#39;ll help you out.</p> </ul> <li><p>Visit the Challenge Day spreadsheet at <a href="http://challenge.julia.party">challenge.julia.party</a>, which will open Saturday morning.</p> <ul> <li><p>You will not be able to attempt any problems that are crossed out. These are problems we attempted in class or were assigned for homework.</p> </ul> <li><p><strong>Get to class on time, before 1:35 EDT.</strong> At this time, we&#39;ll place you into teams of 4 using breakout rooms.</p> </ol> <h3 id=during_the_challenge ><a href="#during_the_challenge">During the challenge</a></h3> <ol start=4 > <li><p><strong>The challenge will start at 1:40 EDT and will last for 45 minutes.</strong> </p> <li><p>Choose problems to solve that are not crossed out or claimed by other teams &#40;which will be highlighted in green&#41; by weighing the point value against how difficult you think the problem will be to solve.</p> <ul> <li><p>Each problem can only be solved by one team, so choose carefully.</p> <li><p>The spreadsheet will be updating live throughout the class as problems are solved.</p> <li><p>You can also check the &quot;Queue&quot; tab of the dashboard to see what problems are being attempted.</p> </ul> <li><p>Use the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/">Julia documentation</a> and any online resources you like, short of directly looking up the solutions to the Euler problems.</p> <ul> <li><p>Violations of this rule include reading blog posts with mathematical solutions to the Euler problem or solutions in other programming languages than Julia.</p> <li><p>As long as what you&#39;re reading doesn&#39;t reference Project Euler or the specific problem you&#39;re solving, you&#39;re probably okay. For example, looking up &quot;lattice paths&quot; is fine, but looking up &quot;project euler problem lattice paths&quot; is not.</p> </ul> <li><p>Collaborate with your team to solve the problems. We recommend turning on your cameras and having someone screenshare as you develop your solutions.</p> <ul> <li><p>You can share pieces of code using the Zoom chat functionality or a collaborative workspace like <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a>.</p> </ul> <li><p>To demonstrate that you have solved a problem &#40;and claim it on the spreadsheet&#41;, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/zTUnPh5HEDwYcH976">this google form</a> to enter the queue.

Whoever has the code can screenshare for the group, but the random member must be the one to present, without help from the group.</p> <ul> <li><p>To get credit, you must briefly walk through your code, explain your strategy, and why it works.</p> <li><p>A good presentation consists of a concise restatement of the problem, clean code, and a coherent explanation.</p> <li><p>If the random team member is unable to explain your work sufficiently, then you will not be able to redeem your points for that problem.</p> </ul> <li><p>The team with the highest number of points redeemed wins the challenge&#33; There is no prize, so just do your best. ðŸ˜Š</p> </ol> <h3 id=after_class ><a href="#after_class">After class</a></h3> <ol start=13 > <li><p>Congrats on finishing Julia&#33; Thanks for learning with us and sticking around.
